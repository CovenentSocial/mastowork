  <h1>About Mastowork</h1>
  <p>
    Mastowork is a decentralized social media platform designed to give users control over their online presence.
    Built on the principles of open-source collaboration and privacy, Mastowork offers a friendly community space 
    that values transparency and creativity.
  </p>

  <h2>Current Status</h2>
  <p>
    Mastowork is currently in active development and available to the public. While anyone can browse and explore,
    sign-ups are currently restricted to approved members only. This ensures a smooth, secure onboarding process 
    as we continue to improve the platform.
  </p>

  <h2>Our Mission</h2>
  <p>
    We aim to empower users with a federated social experience, free from centralized control and censorship.
    Our mission is to support a diverse network of communities that foster meaningful connections and creativity.

    While we continue to build and expand, you can also connect with other instances on the federated network to
    enjoy a wider social experience.
